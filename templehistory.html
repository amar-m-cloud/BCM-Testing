                                  Pokala Dhammakka, an ardent devotee of Rama lived in the 17th 
                                  century and was an inhabitant of Bhadrireddypalem, a mile away 
                                  from this holy place. On one fine night, she had darshan of Rama 
                                  in her dream who said &quot;the saints and sages are worshiping my 
                                  embodied moorthy settled on Bhadragiri&quot; and asked her to trace 
                                  them, perform pooja and attain salvation. On the very next day 
                                  morning she started searching for the idols-peeped into an ant-hill 
                                  and found the idols hidden in it. She poured hundreds of pots 
                                  of Godavari water on the ant-hill which tardily dissolved and 
                                  gave way for the appearance of the hidden Deities. Since then, 
                                  she used to perform pooja daily and offer 'naivedyam' with fruits 
                                  fallen from near palmyra tree and constructed a mandapam of thatch 
                                  hut with the help of local villagers. Bhagawan Rama told Dhammakka 
                                  that at a later date, one of his devotees would construct a Mandir 
                                  at this site. Dhammakka waited patiently for the devotee. The
